There are three binary variants of qsv:
* qsv - feature-capable, with prebuilt binaries enabling all applicable features except Python
* qsvlite - all features disabled (~40% the size of qsv)
* qsvdp - qsv optimized for use with Datapusher+, with only Datapusher+ relevant commands (~40% the size of qsv)

Datapusher+ is only relevant for CKAN installations that use the Datastore.
