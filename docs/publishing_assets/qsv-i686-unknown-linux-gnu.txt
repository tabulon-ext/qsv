The luau feature is not enabled on this prebuilt because of cross-compilation
limitations using GitHub's Action Runners.

As I don't have access to this platform, I do not know if the --luau feature
can even be compiled on it.

If you find that --luau can be enabled on i1686-unknown-linux-gnu, please do
let me know so I can update this note accordingly.
